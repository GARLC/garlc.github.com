I pledge to the citizens of this State, and to the American people, that as
their elected representative I will work to: restore liberty, not restrict it;
shrink government, not expand it; reduce taxes, not raise them; abolish
programs, not create them; promote the freedom and independence of citizens,
not the interference of government in their lives; and observe the limited,
enumerated powers of our Constitution, not ignore them.
