Chairman's Message
------------------

Monday April 8th 2013

> Dear Fellow Republicans-
>
> Please join me and other republicans from across the state on Saturday May 4th in McDonough for the 2013 Republican
> Liberty Caucus of Georgia state convention.  The convention will be used to fill out our board, amend bylaws and draft
> a resolution for the GAGOP state convention.
>
> This caucus affords us a wonderful opportunity to both grow and support our GAGOP and also remain true to our
> convictions of less government, lower taxes and more individual liberty.  I hope that you’ll take the time to read
> through our agenda and compact and will attend our convention.  We are building the structure necessary to effectively
> harness and maximize the enthusiasm of our members now and in the future.  We always want more conservative activists
> to be effectively engaged in local state politics.  Developing strong district captains and a responsive board are
> crucial to our success.
