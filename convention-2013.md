**McDonough, GA**—2pm Saturday May 4th 2013—Georgia republicans from across the state will be
convening in McDonough Saturday May 4th beginning at 1pm.  Liberty caucus members will be electing board positions,
adopting updated bylaws and drafting a resolution for the GAGOP state convention.

"I anticipate a well-run and well attended convention to launch us forward into our newest election cycle," stated
interim caucus chair Carter Kessler.  The RLC of Georgia has recently been transitioning since a December convention in
Woodbury and is now focused on both augmenting the GOP and growing membership participation.

Chairman's Message
------------------

Monday April 8th 2013

> Dear Fellow Republicans-
>
> Please join me and other republicans from across the state on Saturday May 4th in McDonough for the 2013 Republican
> Liberty Caucus of Georgia state convention.  The convention will be used to fill out our board, amend bylaws and draft
> a resolution for the GAGOP state convention.
>
> This caucus affords us a wonderful opportunity to both grow and support our GAGOP and also remain true to our
> convictions of less government, lower taxes and more individual liberty.  I hope that you’ll take the time to read
> through our agenda and compact and will attend our convention.  We are building the structure necessary to effectively
> harness and maximize the enthusiasm of our members now and in the future.  We always want more conservative activists
> to be effectively engaged in local state politics.  Developing strong district captains and a responsive board are
> crucial to our success.  
>
> Thanks for your attention- I hope to see you in McDonough!
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Carter Kessler  
> Interim Chairman RLC of Georgia
