The Republican Liberty Caucus of Georgia (RLCGA), a state chapter of the
[national Republican Liberty Caucus][1] (RLC), was launched to
promote the ideals of limited government, individual liberty, personal
responsibility, free enterprise and adherence to the GA and U.S.
Constitutions among Republican Party officials and throughout the state by
identifying and supporting candidates sympathetic with the organization’s
ideals, and by supporting, through public education and outreach, initiatives
in the GA Legislature that further these ideals.

The national Republican Liberty Caucus was founded in 1991 to promote and
advance traditional Republican Party values within the GOP at state, national
and local levels. Those values—which include low taxes, small government,
individual liberty, 2nd Amendment rights, self-responsibility, free market
capitalism, and adherence to the U.S. Constitution and values reflected in the
Declaration of Independence—have often been forgotten by various politicians
and activists in America.  Originally referred to as “the conscience of the
Republican Party,” the RLC was designed in part to bring the GOP, its
leadership and its elected officials back to its basic principles.  Its national
board of advisors has included U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, national radio talk show
host Neal Boortz, author and Prof. John Hospers, former New Mexico Gov. Gary
Johnson, economist and author Dr. Mark Skousen, and [many others][2].

In Georgia, the RLCGA supports liberty-minded Republican candidates with
activism and talent, among other resources, and the associated Republican
Liberty PAC assists candidates with campaign funding. Potential candidates are
screened by a survey that pinpoints political positions on key economic and
social liberty issues. The voting records of incumbent Georgia Republican
officeholders are also regularly reviewed for adherence to Republican Party
values as reflected in the state constitution and the Georgia Republican
Party platform. State level candidates who are found to support the core RLCGA
values, the state Constitution and the state Republican Party platform are
supported by both RLCGA activism and Republican Liberty PAC funds.

Additionally, the RLCGA uses a weekly RLCGA Report to promote or oppose
legislation that supports or is counter to the core RLCGA principles. When added
with RLCGA white papers, press releases, op-eds and other educational outreach
hand public relations efforts, the RLCGA works tirelessly to advance the liberty
agenda through the Republican Party and elected Republican officials in the
State of Georgia.

The RLCGA Operates according to Bylaws adopted by local leaders and ratified by
the national RLC. Download a copy of the RLCGA bylaws today.
